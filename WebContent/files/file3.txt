Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed fine-grained and privacy preserving data retrieval schemes for MSNs. Centralized and decentralized network models have been considered. The centralized scheme allows users to securely encrypt and upload data to a central server where other users who have the same subject and topics can query the server for subject/topic matching. In the decentralized scheme, we leveraged friends-of-friend relationship and transferrable trust concept in creating a log of users who are interested in a certain subject. In order to reduce the storage and communication overhead, we used Bloom filters to store the users’ topics. Several performance metrics have been proposed and the proposed schemes are extensively evaluated and the results indicated that the proposed schemes can preserve privacy with high performance and low overhead.
