ABSTRACT
Today, users effectively lose control of their data in the cloud, if either the cloud infrastructure or cloud applications are compromised, users' privacy will be at risk. The ubiquitous concern over cloud data privacy demands a paradigm shift, such that users can continue to have control of their data in the cloud environment, and verify that the cloud providers have correctly enforced their privacy policies .We offering strong data security to cloud users while enabling valuable applications is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an efficient public auditing protocol with global and sampling block less verification as well as batch auditing, where data dynamics are substantially more efficiently supported than is the case with the state of the art. Note that the novel dynamic structure in our protocol consists of a doubly linked info table and a location array. Moreover, with such a structure, computational and communication overheads can be reduced substantially. Security analysis indicates that our protocol can achieve the desired properties. Moreover, numerical analysis and real-world experimental results demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves a given efficiency in practice.
