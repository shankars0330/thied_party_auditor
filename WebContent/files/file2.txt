Proposed System
In this paper, we propose privacy-preserving data retrieval schemes for MSNs. We consider centralized and decentralized network models. The centralized scheme follows a client/server architecture in which a server hosts, delivers, and manages most of the resources to connect users based on their common subjects/topics of interest and social attributes. In the decentralized scheme, to build a log of trusted users who have some topics related to a subject of interest, a user broadcasts a request to his trusted friends to query whether they have the subject of interest. The scheme leverages the friends-of-friends relationship and transferrable trust concept, where each user trusts his/her friends and those friends recommended by them. To reduce the storage and computation overhead, Bloom filters are used to store the users’ topics. This is important because topics are fine grained and thus they can be many. The motivation here is that collecting topics only from direct friends may not be enough because they may not have the requested topics. Moreover, the scheme enables the users to share symmetric keys with
friends of friends.
